## Software
Brain Products recommends OpenViBE (http://openvibe.inria.fr/) for the Hackathon, Windows Installer:  http://openvibe.inria.fr/pub/bin/win32/openvibe-1.3.0-setup.exe

There is a  special Demo package designed for Brain Products in OpenViBE, which participants can use: http://www.brainproducts.com/downloads.php?kid=37

Alternatively, Brain Products amplifiers (and many other manufacturers' as well) are fully compatible with labstreaminglayer (LSL): https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1at7yrcFW0. LSL is also supported within OpenViBE.

For users of Pure Data (Pd: http://msp.ucsd.edu/), we have created a suite of externs to interface with LSL: https://github.com/dmedine/PdLSL. This includes [lsl_inlet], [lsl_outlet], and hopefully (by the time of the hackathon) [lsl_inlet~]. These can be modified for use with Max/MSP fairly easily by those that know how to apply Max/MSP glue.
